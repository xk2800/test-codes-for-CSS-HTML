        <p>Below is a pdf link to personal statements and application essays 
            representing strong efforts by students applying for both undergraduate 
            and graduate opportunities. These ten essays have one thing in common: 
            They were all written by students under the constraint of the essay 
            being 1-2 pages due to the target program’s explicit instructions. 
            In such circumstances, writers must attend carefully to the essay 
            prompt (sometimes as simple as “Write a one-page summary of your 
            reasons for wanting to pursue graduate study”) and recognize that 
            evaluators tend to judge these essays on the same fundamental principles, as follows:
            Geological Sciences Samples
            <p>In the pdf link below, the first two one-page statements written by students in the 
            geological sciences are interesting to compare to each other. Despite their different
             areas of research specialization within the same field, both writers demonstrate a 
             good deal of scientific fluency and kinship with their target programs.</p>
            
            <p></p>Geography Student Sample
            The short essay by a geography student applying to an internship program opens with 
            the writer admitting that she previously had a limited view of geography, then 
            describing how a course changed her way of thinking so that she came to understand 
            geography as a “balance of physical, social, and cultural studies.” Despite her 
            limited experience, she shows that she has aspirations of joining the Peace Corps 
            or obtaining a law degree, and her final paragraph links her interests directly to 
            the internship program to which she is applying.</p>
